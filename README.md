# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is a simple calendar application that permits the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery,the Moment.js library was used to get the date and time.
The current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar automatically. Business hours (9AM - 5PM) are displayed with user input areas for each hour. Each timeblock is color coded to show whether it is in the past, present, or future. Inputing a task into a timeblock and clicking the associated save button stores the task in local storage. The saved task will persist in that timeblock when the page is refreshed.
